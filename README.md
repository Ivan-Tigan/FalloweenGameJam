Hack'n'slash your way through creepy monsters that lurk in the dark dungeon - find the goat skull in and sacrifice it to the god of the Pit to gain a gift or a curse - find the key to proceed deeper into the depths of the endless dungeon - and make sure you the light of your torch does not go out...  <br>
